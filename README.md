# Flashcard Generator
A basic flashcard application that runs on the backend with Node.js. It is essentially an API that, via a CLI, allows users to create two different types of flash cards — one typical, the other a "cloze," where part of the text is hidden.

## Getting started

Run 
```
node app.js
```
and follow the prompts to have the time of your life — you'll never look at flashcards the same way again or your money back.
